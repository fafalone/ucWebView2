tB WebView2 Control Wrapper OCX

Wayne Phillips created a wonderful WebView2 control for twinBASIC, but it uses tB's new WindowsControl framework, which isn't compiled to an ocx that can be used by other apps. This project creates an ActiveX control wrapper around the tB control, so it can be compiled into an OCX that can be used in VB6 and VBA (both 32 and 64 bit):
